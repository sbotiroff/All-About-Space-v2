        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Sardor Botirov. I had no knowledge about website design/development at the beginning of this
            class. I became interested ever since I've seen my brother code and after that I changed my path of career
            and switched out of becoming an accountant. I've learned a little bit of HTML and CSS from my brother, but
            it wasn't in much detail as I've learned from in this course. This course has brought to my attention that
            there is plenty of more to learn and that I am able to use them together to create a product or for good
            use on my career. To get more practice, I will be using W3Schools to help me advance my skill. W3schools
            allows me to practice writing scripts &amp; learn several other languages. I am going to take summer
            classes online because I will be going back home to my family. I will be taking intro to python and
            animation with scripting in the summer. I will be reading a book for more practice and I want to make a
            snake game as my final project. Learning the basics of HTML, CSS and a little bit of JavaScript, it has
            helped me learn other languages easier. I've also learned SQL from my intro database class in spring
            quarter which has also been easy to learn this language.
