        <h2>Mercury</h2>
        <p>Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system. It&rsquo;s just a little bigger than
            Earth&rsquo;s moon. It is the closest planet to the sun, but it&rsquo;s actually not the hottest.
            Venus is hotter. Along with Venus, Earth, and Mars, Mercury is one of the rocky planets. It has a
            solid surface that is covered with craters. It has a thin atmosphere, and it doesn&rsquo;t have any
            moons. Mercury likes to keep things simple. This small planet spins around slowly compared to
            Earth, so one day lasts a long time. Mercury takes 59 Earth days to make one full rotation. A year
            on Mercury goes by fast. Because it&rsquo;s the closest planet to the sun, it doesn&rsquo;t take
            very long to go all the way around. It completes one revolution around the sun in just 88 Earth
            days. If you lived on Mercury, you&rsquo;d have a birthday every three months!

        <h2>Venus</h2>
        <p>Even though Venus isn't the closest planet to the sun, it is still the hottest. It has a thick
            atmosphere full of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide and clouds made of sulfuric acid. The gas
            traps heat and keeps Venus toasty warm. In fact, it's so hot on Venus, metals like lead would be
            puddles of melted liquid. Venus looks like a very active planet. It has mountains and volcanoes.
            Venus is similar in size to Earth. Earth is just a little bit bigger.

        <h2>Earth</h2>
        <p>
            Our home planet Earth is a rocky, terrestrial planet. It has a solid and active surface with
            mountains, valleys, canyons, plains and so much more. Earth is special because it is an ocean
            planet. Water covers 70% of Earth's surface. Our atmosphere is made mostly of nitrogen and has
            plenty of oxygen for us to breathe. The atmosphere also protects us from incoming meteoroids, most
            of which break up in our atmosphere before they can strike the surface as meteorites.

        <img src="./images/planets/mars-transparent.png" alt="planet mars">

        <h2>Mars</h2>
        <p>Mars is a cold desert world. It is half the size of Earth. Mars is sometimes called the Red Planet.
            It's red because of rusty iron in the ground. Like Earth, Mars has seasons, polar ice caps,
            volcanoes, canyons, and weather. It has a very thin atmosphere made of carbon dioxide, nitrogen,
            and argon. There are signs of ancient floods on Mars, but now water mostly exists in icy dirt and
            thin clouds. On some Martian hillsides, there is evidence of liquid salty water in the ground.
            Scientists want to know if Mars may have had living things in the past. They also want to know if
            Mars could support life now or in the future.

        <img src="./images/planets/jupiter-transparent.png" alt="planet jupiter">

        <h2>Jupiter</h2>
        <p>Jupiter is the biggest planet in our solar system. It's similar to a star, but it never got big
            enough to start burning. It is covered in swirling cloud stripes. It has big storms like the Great
            Red Spot, which has been going for hundreds of years. Jupiter is a gas giant and doesn't have a
            solid surface, but it may have a solid inner core about the size of Earth. Jupiter also has rings,
            but they're too faint to see very well.

        <img src="./images/planets/saturn-transparent.png" alt="planet saturn">

        <h2>Saturn</h2>
        <p>Saturn isn't the only planet to have rings, but it definitely has the most beautiful ones. The rings
            we see are made of groups of tiny ringlets that surround Saturn. They're made of chunks of ice and
            rock. Like Jupiter, Saturn is mostly a ball of hydrogen and helium.

            When Galileo Galilei saw Saturn through a telescope in the 1600s, he wasn't sure what he was
            seeing. At first he thought he was looking at three planets, or a planet with handles. Now we know
            those "handles" turned out to be the rings of Saturn.

        <img src="./images/planets/uranus-transparent.png" alt="planet uranus">

        <h2>Uranus</h2>
        <p>Uranus is made of water, methane, and ammonia fluids above a small rocky center. Its atmosphere
            is
            made of hydrogen and helium like Jupiter and Saturn, but it also has methane. The methane makes
            Uranus blue.

            Uranus also has faint rings. The inner rings are narrow and dark. The outer rings are brightly
            colored and easier to see. Like Venus, Uranus rotates in the opposite direction as most other
            planets. And unlike any other planet, Uranus rotates on its side.

        <img src="./images/planets/neptune-transparent.png" alt="planet neptune">

        <h2>Neptune</h2>
        <p>Neptune is dark, cold, and very windy. It's the last of the planets in our solar system. It's more
            than 30 times as far from the sun as Earth is. Neptune is very similar to Uranus. It's made of a
            thick soup of water, ammonia, and methane over an Earth-sized solid center. Its atmosphere is made
            of hydrogen, helium, and methane. The methane gives Neptune the same blue color as Uranus. Neptune
            has six rings, but they're very hard to see.
